/**
 * agentOverlayWriter — the substrate-shared seam that materializes a project's
 * EFFECTIVE agent set (built-in catalogue + `agent_overrides`) into a run's
 * worktree `.claude/agents/` directory, so BOTH CLI substrates auto-discover the
 * project's customized agents at spawn (migration 029 / agent gallery feature).
 *
 * This is layered ON TOP of `WorkflowBundleWriter`: that writer places a flow's
 * sibling-bundle agents verbatim; this overlay then writes the FULL effective set
 * (every builtin, override-applied, plus any custom agents) so a custom/quick flow
 * with no sibling bundle still gets the project's agents, and an overridden builtin
 * gets its override body instead of the bundled body. Each file is written as
 * `cyboflow-<agentKey>.md` — the same namespace `WorkflowBundleWriter` owns, so a
 * later overlay write simply re-writes (overrides) the bundle's file for that key.
 *
 * For an UNOVERRIDDEN builtin we write `effective.rawContent` VERBATIM (byte-for-byte
 * the bundled `.md`); otherwise we render via `renderAgentMarkdown` (which forces the
 * frontmatter name to `cyboflow-<key>` regardless of any stored name).
 *
 * NEVER removes/clears anything (the bundle writer owns the cyboflow-* lifecycle) and
 * NEVER throws — an overlay failure must not break a spawn (wrapped in try/catch +
 * `logger?.warn`).
 *
 * DEVIATION FROM PLAN: the overlay is fully SYNCHRONOUS (better-sqlite3 reads and
 * `writeFileSync` are sync) and is invoked inside the synchronous
 * `installWorkflowBundle` seam — the plan speculated an async wrapper invoked from
 * each manager, but synchronous-at-the-single-seam is simpler and requires no
 * manager call-site changes (both substrates inherit it from that one seam).
 *
 * Like `workflowBundleInstall`, this helper bridges DB + catalogue + renderer, so it
 * MAY import better-sqlite3 and the orchestrator agent modules.
