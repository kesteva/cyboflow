# Changelog

All notable changes to **Cyboflow** are documented in this file.

Cyboflow is a fork of [Crystal](https://github.com/stravu/crystal) at tag `0.3.5` and has
diverged substantially in scope and architecture. The original upstream Crystal changelog is
preserved at [`docs/archive/CHANGELOG-crystal.md`](docs/archive/CHANGELOG-crystal.md) — note
that Cyboflow does **not** track the renamed successor product (Nimbalyst); see
[`docs/PROVENANCE.md`](docs/PROVENANCE.md).

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

- Ongoing narrowing/rebuild of the Crystal baseline into Cyboflow. See the git history and
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the current component layout.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **Shared production database across installed apps.** Both packaged variants —
  Cyboflow and Cyboflow Dev — now read the local production database at `~/.cyboflow`.
  Dev is a separate *update channel*, not a separate dataset, so the two installed
  apps stay in lockstep on one machine. The non-packaged Electron dev server
  (`pnpm dev`) keeps its own isolated `~/.cyboflow_dev` so local development never
  mutates or forward-migrates the installed apps' database.

### Added

- **Schema-version gate.** Because both variants share one database and migrations
  are forward-only, an older build could previously run against a schema a newer
  build had already advanced — risking silent corruption. On launch, Cyboflow now
  stamps `PRAGMA user_version` with the highest migration it ships and, if the
  database is newer than the running build, shows a warning dialog
  (**Check for Updates** / **Open Anyway** / **Quit**) instead. *Check for Updates*
  opens Settings → Updates automatically.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-23

First signed, notarized, and auto-updating macOS builds.

### Added

- **Signed + notarized macOS distribution.** Developer ID-signed, Apple-notarized
  builds with lean per-architecture DMGs (arm64 and x64) and in-app auto-update via
  `electron-updater` against `updates.cyboflow.com` (a combined `latest-mac.yml`
  serves both architectures).
- **Cyboflow Dev** — a side-by-side build variant (own appId, name, and update feed)
  for testing pre-release builds, in the style of VS Code Insiders.
- **Ship workflow** — a fourth built-in flow that combines Planner and Sprint in a
  single run (idea → epics → tasks → execute → integrate), launched from an idea picker.
- **Programmatic sprint execution** with a DAG-aware fan-out that runs independent
  tasks in parallel lanes, plus a monitor you can chat with at rest in the run's Chat pane.
- **Always-available Shell tab** in run views — a plain shell in the run's git worktree,
  keyed by run id.
- **Reopen timed-out or failed runs** directly from the composer.

### Fixed

- SDK agent sessions no longer hang in packaged builds — the native `claude` binary
  is unpacked from the asar archive so it can be spawned. The bundled MCP server is
  likewise packaged so `cyboflow_*` tools work in distributed builds.
- The `better-sqlite3` native module is rebuilt for the Electron ABI before packaging,
  fixing a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` crash on launch.
- Flow-run context meter no longer pegs at 100%; a torn-down awaiting-input run now
  rests in `awaiting_review` instead of wedging.
